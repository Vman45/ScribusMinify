Very simple shell script to create a Scribus file that contains scaled-down images only. The images are scaled so that they are all the same resolution in the final document.
It reduces the file size of a generated PDF dramatically, I was able to scale down a 212 MB PDF to mere 41 MB (300dpi) or 55 MB (360 dpi) this way.
